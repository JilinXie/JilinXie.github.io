        <h4>Start my github page.</h4>

<pre><code>Jekyll seems a better choice for most people.
But after trying a little, I somehow decided to make my own one.
And it turns out not very hard. Since all I want is to put some stuff on github page.
And I don't expect people to find or read it~

But whatever, I'm gonna try to make this little stuff better and more useful~

So,, This is the official initial post~
