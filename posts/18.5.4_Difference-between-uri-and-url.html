        <h4>Difference between URL and URI</h4>

<ul>
<li>URI: Uniform Resource Identifiers.</li>
<li>URL: Uniform Resource Locator.</li>
<li>URN: Uniform Resource Name.</li>
</ul>

<p>'''
    Both URI and URL can also be called URI.
    URL indicates the way to locate a resource, thus, it contains a protocol(http, ftp and etc.)
    URN and URIS(Those are not URLS) defines a unique name of a resource (within a defined namespace). 
    URN may comes with its own scheme urn:uuid:xxxxx, which means uniform-name-innamespace-uuid: xxxx.
    While URI can use urn and other scheme, tag:, info: etc. These scheme are not location scheme. they are often assigned by relating procedure.
