#### Start my github page.

    Jekyll seems a better choice for most people.
    But after trying a little, I somehow decided to make my own one.
    And it turns out not very hard. Since all I want is to put some stuff on github page.
    And I don't expect people to find or read it~

    But whatever, I'm gonna try to make this little stuff better and more useful~

    So,, This is the official initial post~
